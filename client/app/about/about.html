	    	<h3 class="about-header">Summary</h3>
			<p class="text-body">I was born and raised in Hopewell New Jersey.  After high school, I attended the University of New Hampshire (UNH) with a focus in Mechanical Engineering.  My first job after UNH took me to Boston where I worked for a medical device company called Waters.  A few years later, I took a design job at GOSS International in New Hampshire.  The recession claimed many jobs in 2009, mine included.  It was at this point I co-founded a small company named JAS Energy in Blacksburg Virginia.   I currently am working as an engineer at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.</p>

			<p class="text-body">My academic interests lie in technology, business, finance, and investing.  I am avidly seeking new investment opportunities within the stock market.  My philosophy is that of a classic value investor following the teachings of Ben Graham, and Warren Buffet, and am always looking to buy stock of well performing stock at depressed prices.   I am also interested in the world of business and business development.  My most current interests lie in web development, most notably JavaScript and front end/back end frameworks.  In the near future, I will be developing fully interactive, rich, and useful web applications from scratch.  Please check back here often for updates. </p>

			<h3 class="about-header">Outside of work</h3>

			<p class="text-body">When I am not busy with work or a project, I like to keep an active social life.  I work out on a daily basis and believe in healthy living.  I’ll play most sports, but I enjoy Ice hockey (or street) the most.  Many say I have a pretty good shot, but it isn’t quite an NHL release just yet!  When the weekend comes around, I like to make time after a productive day to enjoy a night out with friends.  Travelling is another passion of mine.  I have been overseas a few times, most notably in 2014 when I backpacked on my own through three countries.  It was a great experience and I met a lot of great people along the way.  </p>
